## Analysis of Arable Land, African Cassava Crop Yield, and United States Fertilizer Use vs. Wheat Crop Yield

# Our World in Data
The data used in this analysis was sourced from Our World in Data, from a 2017 article by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser. The five individual data sets were compiled through a Github Tidy Tuesday posting, and was downloaded on March 17, 2021.

## Data Cleaning
First, I cleaned the data sets for ease of analysis. For each data set, I cleaned and shortened the column names. For the “land_use” data set, I converted the “year” variable to a numeric type. I then saved each cleaned data set as a new .csv file in the “data_processed” folder.

# Exploratory Analysis
## Research Questions
1. Which entity had the largest amount of arable land needed to produce a 1961-equivalent amount of agricultural output in 2014?

2. How has cassava crop yields in Nigeria changed over time?

3. How has the wheat yield in the United States changed between 2002 and 2014 as compared to fertilizer use in the same time period?

# Arable Land
Arable land is land that is capable of growing crops. In the “arable_land_analysis” data set, the measure “arable_land” refers to the area of arable land needed to produce an equivalent aggregate of crop production, relative to base year 1961. This measures how a entity’s amount of arable land, or agriculture potential, has changed over time. As it measures the amount of arable land needed to produce some base amount of agricultural output, this variable measures how a entity’s agricultural productivity has changed over time.
